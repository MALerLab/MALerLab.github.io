**Music and Art Learning (MALer) Lab** (@ Dept. Art & Technology, Sogang University) aims to understand music and art computationally, especially through deep learning. Our research interests covers broad music information retrieval including computational modeling of music generation and music performance, computational musicology, and cross-modal generation. The ultimate goal of our research is to enhance artistic experiences in our society based on our computational understanding of music and art.

We are currently seeking highly motivated Master's/Ph.D. students for the academic year of 2025 who are interested in Deep Learning based Music Information Retrieval (MIR). The topics we are currently interested in are as follows:
- MIR for Music Education
- MIR for Korean Traditional Music (Analysis)
- MIR for Western Classical Music (Transcription, OMR, Alignment, etc)
- Symbolic Music Generation
- MIDI-to-Audio Synthesis
- Computational Musicology

<br/>

For admission, you can refer following websites. But please contact [here](mailto:dasaemj@sogang.ac.kr) before you apply.
- [Graduate Program at the Department of Art & Technology](https://creative.sogang.ac.kr/academics/academics_graduate-program-cloned-30309/)
- [Graduate School of AI](https://ai.sogang.ac.kr/ai/index_new.html)

<!--Our research group is currently at full capacity and not accepting new applicants for graduate program. Please check back for future openings. -->

If you're interested in the research conducted in our lab, we highly recommend taking AATG015 - Deep Learning for Music & Audio as it provides a solid foundation for the work we do and will give you a head start on potential research projects in the future.

<!--For any questions or further information, please contact [here](mailto:dasaemj@sogang.ac.kr)-->
